## üìù Introduction:

Have you ever had a day or week when it seems that everything does not go the way that you expect? You forgot your car keys, missed the bus, or arrived late for an interview for a new job all while trying to complete everything on your to do list? Nowadays, this happens to everyone because we all seem to be busy all the time. And due to the pressure and strain of this busyness, the simple things in our daily life get forgotten and overtaken by other priorities and distractions. Certainly, we are busier now than decades ago, when no computers, smartphones with social media, or emails constantly interrupted our lives

That is where BetterDay comes in. In order to help people with their daily life, the BetterDay application promises to help the user to solve simple tasks by analysing and understanding the user's daily routine and makes suggestions to help the user to avoid having a similar bad day in the future.
